            <h1>Welcome to Travelers Gallery</h1>
            <p>This galleries mission is to allow people from the community and all around the world to have another home for their art.
                We established the Travelers Gallery in 2018 and hope to expand awarness of our business. The Gallery is home to mostly abstract and surrealist works.
                Our Gallery wants to show off art that saturates its viewers with emotion. That is why we want to represent artists from anywhere and everywhere. 
            </p>

            <p>We're very excited to offer art classes on the weekends. We want to give people the opportunity to learn about different types of art and the best techniques to use. 
                The classes will be taught by artists that have works in the gallery and we do offer course packages. It's $250 to do course packages and $100 for 1 day lessons.

    <h3>Oil painting</h3>
    <p>Oil painting is such a fun way to experiment with blending, glazing and scumbling. Your painting can dry faster or slower depending on the paint thinners and additional oil used.
        Oil painting is considered higher in the art world compared to acrylic paintings and was used by many successful artists. Oil paint is made up of ground pigment suspended in drying oil.

        <h3>Abstract art</h3>
        <p>The world of abstract art was birthed in the 19th century. It's art that takes on shape, color, lines and texture. 
            Abstract is an art form that makes you tap into the imagination and try to bring out something that can't be regularly seen.
