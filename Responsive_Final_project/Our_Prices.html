            <h1> For First Time Shoppers!</h1>
            <p> Our brand really appreciates your interest in our custom griptape so we give a 15% discount on your first purchase. 
                It can be any grip material of your choosing such as Mob and Jessup. 
                If you're wanting something quicker rather than something drawn on your board, we also do prints as well. 
                Once you've selected the size of grip and image, it will take us a couple of days to a week to send it out to you.
            </p>

            </ul>
            <p> Our prices depend on the level of difficulty the piece will take to make. The griptape price is included in your purchase so when you pick out the kind of grip material you want that adds on approximately $10.00. 
                If you've chosen a print or pattern we do those for $25.00. 
                If you've chosen simple characters or word art thats between $35-$65 dollars. More detailed pieces are between $80-$120.
                The prices also vary on the amount of hours it takes to create the art piece that's why certain prices differ a bit.
