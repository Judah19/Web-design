    <h2>Welcome to My Website</h2>
    <p>We do custom griptape art for any shape of board you like to ride. What is custom grip tape? Its when someone draws designs or cuts out different grip shapes to make a cool image on top of a skateboard. Our brand likes to accomadate our customers by allowing a 15% discount on their first purchase. It can be any grip material of your choosing such as Mob and Jessup. The pens we use are oil based but if you're wanting something quicker we also do prints as well. Once you've selected the size of grip and image, it will take us a couple of days to a week to send it out to you.
