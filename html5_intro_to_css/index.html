            <p>Our vision is to expand our resort to other parts of the country so everyone can have a taste of the snowbaording and skiers adventure. We want to build a community of snowboarders and skiers that have a second place to call home. Our business has been around for 30 years and hopefully 30 more. Our mission is to help each rider that comes through our door to feel accomplished when they leave. We want everyone to have a great overall experience with us and to come back again. </p>
