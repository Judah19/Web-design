            <h1> About Judahs GripArt!</h1>
            <p>During Covid-19 many skate companies weren't producing colorful gripart or didn't have many graphic grip to choose from. 
                I love having colorful grip rather than just plaine black griptape, so I bought markers online and started doing art on regular griptape. 
                This allowed me to make my skateboard a canvas and start selling my art to other riders during the pandemic. 
                I kept getting better and better at making art on such a rough surface. I was also getting more customers when the pandemic was over. 
                It now has become a business instead of a side hustle that I had in high school and I'm so gratful.
                Our vision is to send art to skaters all around the country who share a love for skateboarding that is equal to our company. 
                If there are any problems with your purchase email us as soon as possible and we will help to the best of our abilities.
